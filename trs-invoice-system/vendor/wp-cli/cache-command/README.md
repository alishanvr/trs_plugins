## Using

This package implements the following commands:

### wp cache

Manipulate the WP Object Cache object.

~~~
wp cache
~~~

By default, the WP Object Cache exists in PHP memory for the length of the
request (and is emptied at the end). Use a persistent object cache drop-in
to persist the object cache between requests.

[Read the codex article](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache)
for more detail.

**EXAMPLES**

    # Set cache.
    $ wp cache set my_key my_value my_group 300
    Success: Set object 'my_key' in group 'my_group'.

    # Get cache.
    $ wp cache get my_key my_group
    my_value



### wp transient

Manipulate the WordPress Transient Cache.

~~~
wp transient
~~~

By default, the transient cache uses the WordPress database to persist values
between requests. When a persistent object cache drop-in is installed, the
transient cache also uses the WordPress Object Cache.

**EXAMPLES**

    # Set transient.
    $ wp transient set sample_key "test data" 3600
    Success: Transient added.

    # Get transient.
    $ wp transient get sample_key
    test data

    # Delete transient.
    $ wp transient delete sample_key
    Success: Transient deleted.

    # Delete expired transients.
    $ wp transient delete --expired
    Success: 12 expired transients deleted from the database.

    # Delete all transients.
    $ wp transient delete --all
    Success: 14 transients deleted from the database.
